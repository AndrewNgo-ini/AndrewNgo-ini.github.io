        subtitle: So, I had this crazy idea the other day. I was like, "what if I turn my brain into a freaking hash-table?" Like, seriously, picture it. My brain is now this super cool, tech-savvy tool that can store all the concepts I want to remember as keys, and the blog posts I wrote as the corresponding values. How awesome is that?! Now, whenever I need to revisit something I learned, I can just access my brain-hash and voila! It's like having a personal search engine in my head. So, if you're curious to see how it all works, check out my blog and let me know what you think! - written by ChatGPT
